This repository so far contains mergefiles multi python script, tool to merge together different IC SCs files. The initial paramter must be given in the command line, read inside mergefiles to know the order (to be improved).

If you have to merge multiple files it can be useful to use the bash script launch... it prevents from having to write all the files to be merged.
